Changed to two scripts.
The first script checks for .txt files
in the directory and creates a window
with a dropdown menu that lets user pick
an option to make the list from. Then it
calls the second script and passes the
the name of the file chosen to it.

The second script then generates and 
displays a list with checkboxes in a window.
